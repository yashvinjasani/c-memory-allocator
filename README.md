Efficient Memory Allocation in C
Efficient Memory Allocation in C (mymalloc)View the Live Interactive ShowcaseThis project is a custom implementation of a dynamic memory allocator in C, replicating the core functionality of malloc() and free(). It is designed to be efficient, robust, and to demonstrate a deep understanding of low-level memory management, including strategies to combat fragmentation and handle common allocation errors.Testing StrategyThe allocator was validated using a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure correctness, performance, and reliability under stress.Test 1: Malloc Reserves Unallocated MemoryRequirement: malloc() must return a pointer to an object that does not overlap with any other allocated object.Detection Method: Test1.c allocates multiple memory blocks and writes distinct patterns to each. It then verifies that none of the patterns have overwritten each other.Expected Outcome: The test should output "No Overlap Detected".Test 2: Free Deallocates MemoryRequirement: free() makes a memory block available for subsequent allocations.Detection Method: Test2.c allocates a large chunk that consumes most of the heap, frees it, and then attempts to allocate another large chunk. This second allocation should only succeed if the first was correctly deallocated.Expected Outcome: The program should run to completion without any errors.Test 3: Coalescing Adjacent Free BlocksRequirement: Adjacent free blocks in memory are merged to form a single, larger free block to reduce fragmentation.Detection Method: Test3.c allocates several chunks to fill the heap, frees two adjacent chunks, and then attempts to allocate a new chunk equal to their combined size.Expected Outcome: The program should run to completion, proving the large allocation was successful.Test 4: Error Detection and ReportingRequirement: The allocator must detect and report errors related to improper free() usage.Detection Method:Test4_1.c: Attempts to free a pointer that was not returned by malloc().Test4_2.c: Attempts to free an address that is not the start of an allocated chunk.Test4_3.c: Attempts to free the same pointer twice (a double free).Expected Outcome: Each of these test files should output a descriptive error message.Test 5: Leak Detection and ReportingRequirement: Any memory allocated but not freed by the end of the program's execution should be identified as a memory leak.Detection Method: Test5.c allocates multiple chunks but only frees some of them.Expected Outcome: The program should report the total number of bytes leaked and the number of leaked objects.How to Compile and RunTo compile all test executables, use the provided Makefile:make all
To run a specific test:./Test1
To clean up all compiled object files and executables:make clean
